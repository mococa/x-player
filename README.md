# X-Player

This was a hackathon, I challenged myself to make something like Twitter (X), and a music player.

The music player working flawlessly and with a great UX. Same for when posting something.

The CMS is not very secure, though, as it was made in around 3 days, but it uses Spotify API to fetch the song data and we upload from our computer.

## Demo

There is a hosted version at https://x-player.moureau.dev
